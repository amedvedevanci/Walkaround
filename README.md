# Walkaround
A Java exercise to explore inheritance.

<h3>The Question:</h3>
<i>
This is an open task, exact design and completion is up to you.

Create an application that uses Inheritance. Your application should have 3 classes, a superclass, a subclass and an app class that implements an object of the subclass.

For instance:

Bike>Mountain Bike>Specific bike object </i>

<h3>My solution:</h3>

I created a simple text-based adventure where the user walks around, picks up items and tries to escape the game.
This solution still has lots of expansion potential through adding subclasses, expanding inventory, adding a front-end...

The WalkAroundApp class interacts with the Location instantiable/superclass, which is implemented by Living Room and Kitchen classes.
